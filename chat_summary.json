The AI offered a set of questions regarding the button's positioning and functionality, providing two options for each inquiry. The user was prompted to specify whether they wanted the button in a fixed location or to appear dynamically, as well as outlining the specific action the button should trigger. Following this, the AI presented a checklist of potential features for implementation, including the addition of animated effects and sound, various user engagement options, and a leaderboard for top users. The user checked several features, such as an animated Hadoken effect and a leaderboard, while leaving sound effects and user profile avatars unchecked. The AI acknowledged the request, confirming that the Hadoken button would be incorporated into the project immediately. The user was then asked to describe the project further for better understanding.",
